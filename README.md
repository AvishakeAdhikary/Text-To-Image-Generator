> This project uses the Stable Diffusion Pipeline to generate images from text prompts. The Stable Diffusion Pipeline is a machine learning model that uses a diffusion process to generate images from text prompts.
> This is a simple GUI application for generating images based on user prompts using the StableDiffusionPipeline model from the diffusers module. The application allows users to enter a prompt, click a button to generate an image based on the prompt, and view the generated image in the GUI window.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have a GPU and install the following dependencies:

- PyTorch
- diffusers
- matplotlib

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- tkinter module
- customtkinter module
- diffusers module
- torch module
- Pillow module

You can install these dependencies using pip. For example:

```
pip install tkinter
```
```
pip install customtkinter
```
```
pip install diffusers
```
```
pip install torch
```
```
pip install Pillow
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the code by running the following command:

```
python imagegenerator.py
```

## Usage

When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter a text prompt. Once you have entered a text prompt, the Stable Diffusion Pipeline will generate an image based on the text prompt. The generated image will be displayed using matplotlib.
